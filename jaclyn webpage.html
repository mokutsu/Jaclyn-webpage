  <h1>My running story. </h1>
  <p> I started running when I was very young and competitively when I was 15.  I was competitive all throughout
  highschool and took a bit of a break while in University. I ran a little bit recreationally
but it wasnt until I was 26 that I really picked it back up (8 years since graduating highschool!) Since then I have
ran the New York, London, Berlin and Chicago Marathons, completed seven half Marathons and a handful of
5 km and 10 km races.  I most recently ran my 5 km and half marathon pbs!
